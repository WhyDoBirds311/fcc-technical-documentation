				<p>AJAX is a web development technique for creating interactive web applications. If you know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML, then you need to spend just one hour to start with AJAX.</p>

				<h3>Why to learn AJAX?</h3>
				
				<p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.
					</li>
					<li>
						Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the sever using synchronous requests. It means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server.
					</li>
					<li>
						With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.
					</li>
					<li>
						XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used.
					</li>
					<li>
						AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.
					</li>
					<li>
						A user can continue to use the application while the client program requests information from the server in the background.
					</li>
					<li>
						Intuitive and natural user interaction. Clicking is not required, mouse movement is a sufficient event trigger.
					</li>
					<li>
						Data-driven as opposed to page-driven.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Rich Internet Application Technology</h3>

				<p>
					AJAX is the most viable Rich Internet Application (RIA) technology so far. It is getting tremendous industry momentum and several tool kit and frameworks are emerging. But at the same time, AJAX has browser incompatibility and it is supported by JavaScript, which is hard to maintain and debug.
				</p>

				<h3>AJAX is Based on Open Standards</h3>

				<p>
					AJAX is based on the following open standards −
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Browser-based presentation using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</li>
					<li>Data is stored in XML format and fetched from the server.</li>
					<li>Behind-the-scenes data fetches using XMLHttpRequest objects in the browser.</li>
					<li>JavaScript to make everything happen.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Audience</h3>
				<p>
					This tutorial will be useful for web developers who want to learn how to create interactive webpages as well as improve their speed and usability using AJAX.
				</p>

				<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
				<p>
					It is highly recommended that you are familiar with HTML and JavaScript before attempting this tutorial.

				<header>Browser Support</header>
				<p>All the available browsers cannot support AJAX. Here is a list of major browsers that support AJAX.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Mozilla Firefox 1.0 and above.</li>
					<li>Netscape version 7.1 and above.</li>
					<li>Apple Safari 1.2 and above.</li>
					<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 and above.</li>
					<li>Konqueror.</li>
					<li>Opera 7.6 and above.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When you write your next application, do consider the browsers that do not support AJAX.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>NOTE</strong> − When we say that a browser does not support AJAX, it simply means that the browser does not support the creation of Javascript object – XMLHttpRequest object.
				</p>

				<h3>Writing Browser Specific Code</h3>
				<p>The simplest way to make your source code compatible with a browser is to use <em>try...catch</em> blocks in your JavaScript.</p>

				
				<code>
					  <pre>  
					         //Browser Support Code
					         function ajaxFunction() {
					            var ajaxRequest;  // The variable that makes Ajax possible!

					            try {
					               // Opera 8.0+, Firefox, Safari 
					               ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
					            } catch (e) {

					               // Internet Explorer Browsers
					               try {
					                  ajaxRequest = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
					               } catch (e) {
					                  
					                  try {
					                     ajaxRequest = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
					                  } catch (e) {

					                     // Something went wrong
					                     alert("Your browser broke!");
					                     return false;
					                  }
					               }
					            }
					         }
					    </pre>
				</code>

				<p>In the above JavaScript code, we try three times to make our XMLHttpRequest object. Our first attempt −</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();</li>
				</ul>

				<p>It is for Opera 8.0+, Firefox, and Safari browsers. If it fails, we try two more times to make the correct object for an Internet Explorer browser with −</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ajaxRequest = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");</li>
					<li>ajaxRequest = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					If it doesn't work, then we can use a very outdated browser that doesn't support XMLHttpRequest, which also means it doesn't support AJAX.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="action">
				<header>Action</header>
				<p>This chapter gives you a clear picture of the exact steps of AJAX operation.</p>

				<h3>Steps of AJAX Operation</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A client event occurs.</li>
					<li>An XMLHttpRequest object is created.</li>
					<li>The XMLHttpRequest object is configured.</li>
					<li>The XMLHttpRequest object makes an asynchronous request to the Webserver.</li>
					<li>The Webserver returns the result containing XML document.</li>
					<li>The XMLHttpRequest object calls the callback() function and processes the result.</li>
					<li>The HTML DOM is updated.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Let us take these steps one by one.</p>

				<h3>A Client Event Occurs</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A JavaScript function is called as the result of an event.</li>
					<li>Example − <em>validateUserId()</em> JavaScript function is mapped as an event handler to an onkeyup event on input form field whose id is set to <em>"userid"</em></li>
					<li>input type = "text" size = "20" id = "userid" name = "id" onkeyup = "validateUserId();".'</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>The XMLHttpRequest Object is Created</h3>
				<code>
					<pre>
						var ajaxRequest;  // The variable that makes Ajax possible!
							function ajaxFunction() {
							   try {
							      // Opera 8.0+, Firefox, Safari
							      ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
							   } catch (e) {
							   
							      // Internet Explorer Browsers
							      try {
							         ajaxRequest = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
							      } catch (e) {
							      
							         try {
							            ajaxRequest = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
							         } catch (e) {
							      
							            // Something went wrong
							            alert("Your browser broke!");
							            return false;
							         }
							      }
							   }
							}
					</pre>
				</code>

				<h3>The XMLHttpRequest Object is Configured</h3>
				<p>In this step, we will write a function that will be triggered by the client event and a callback function processRequest() will be registered.</p>
				<code>
					<pre>
					function validateUserId() {
					   ajaxFunction();
					   
					   // Here processRequest() is the callback function.
					   ajaxRequest.onreadystatechange = processRequest;
					   
					   if (!target) target = document.getElementById("userid");
					   var url = "validate?id=" + escape(target.value);
					   
					   ajaxRequest.open("GET", url, true);
					   ajaxRequest.send(null);
					}
					</pre>
				</code>

				<h3>Making Asynchronous Request to the Webserver</h3>
				<p>Source code is available in the above piece of code. Code written in bold typeface is responsible to make a request to the webserver. This is all being done using the XMLHttpRequest object <em>ajaxRequest</em>.</p>
				<code>
					<pre>
						function validateUserId() {
							   ajaxFunction();
							   
							   // Here processRequest() is the callback function.
							   ajaxRequest.onreadystatechange = processRequest;
							   
							   if (!target) target = document.getElementById("userid");
							   var url = "validate?id = " + escape(target.value);
							   
							   ajaxRequest.open("GET", url, true);
							   ajaxRequest.send(null);
							}
					</pre>
				</code>
				<p>Assume you enter Zara in the userid box, then in the above request, the URL is set to <em>"validate?id = Zara"</em>.</p>

				<h3>Webserver Returns the Result Containing XML Document</h3>
				<p>You can implement your server-side script in any language, however its logic should be as follows.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Get a request from the client.</li>
					<li>Parse the input from the client.</li>
					<li>Do required processing.</li>
					<li>Send the output to the client.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If we assume that you are going to write a servlet, then here is the piece of code.</p>

				<code>
					<pre>
						public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
						   HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {
						   String targetId = request.getParameter("id");
						   
						   if ((targetId != null) && !accounts.containsKey(targetId.trim())) {
						      response.setContentType("text/xml");
						      response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
						      response.getWriter().write("<valid>true</valid>");
						   } else {
						      response.setContentType("text/xml");
						      response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
						      response.getWriter().write("<valid>false</valid>");
						   }
						}
					</pre>
				</code>

				<h3>Callback Function processRequest() is Called</h3>
				<p>The XMLHttpRequest object was configured to call the processRequest() function when there is a state change to the readyState of the XMLHttpRequest object. Now this function will receive the result from the server and will do the required processing. As in the following example, it sets a variable message on true or false based on the returned value from the Webserver.</p>

				<code>
					<pre>
						function processRequest() {
							   if (req.readyState == 4) {
							      if (req.status == 200) {
							         var message = ...;
							...
							}
												</pre>
				</code>

				<h3>The HTML DOM is Updated</h3>
				<p>This is the final step and in this step, your HTML page will be updated. It happens in the following way −</p>
				<ul>
					<li>JavaScript gets a reference to any element in a page using DOM API.</li>
					<li>The recommended way to gain a reference to an element is to call.
						<code>
							<pre>
								document.getElementById("userIdMessage"), 
									// where "userIdMessage" is the ID attribute 
									// of an element appearing in the HTML document
							</pre>
						</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						JavaScript may now be used to modify the element's attributes; modify the element's style properties; or add, remove, or modify the child elements. Here is an example −

						<code>
							<pre>
								document.getElementById("userIdMessage"), 
								// where "userIdMessage" is the ID attribute 
								// of an element appearing in the HTML document
								JavaScript may now be used to modify the element's attributes; modify the element's style properties; or add, remove, or modify the child elements. Here is an example −

							  script type = "text/javascript">
								  
								   function setMessageUsingDOM(message) {
								      var userMessageElement = document.getElementById("userIdMessage");
								      var messageText;
								      
								      if (message == "false") {
								         userMessageElement.style.color = "red";
								         messageText = "Invalid User Id";
								      } else {
								         userMessageElement.style.color = "green";
								         messageText = "Valid User Id";
								      }
								      
								      var messageBody = document.createTextNode(messageText);
								      
								      // if the messageBody element has been created simple 
								      // replace it otherwise append the new element
								      if (userMessageElement.childNodes[0]) {
								         userMessageElement.replaceChild(messageBody, userMessageElement.childNodes[0]);
								      } else {
								         userMessageElement.appendChild(messageBody);
								      }
								   }
								   
								/script>

								body>
								   div id = "userIdMessage"><?div>
								/body> 
							</pre>
						</code>
					</li>

				<header>XMLHttpRequest</header>
				<p>
					The XMLHttpRequest object is the key to AJAX. It has been available ever since Internet Explorer 5.5 was released in July 2000, but was not fully discovered until AJAX and Web 2.0 in 2005 became popular.
				</p>

				<p>
					XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is an API that can be used by JavaScript, JScript, VBScript, and other web browser scripting languages to transfer and manipulate XML data to and from a webserver using HTTP, establishing an independent connection channel between a webpage's Client-Side and Server-Side.
				</p>

				<p>
					The data returned from XMLHttpRequest calls will often be provided by back-end databases. Besides XML, XMLHttpRequest can be used to fetch data in other formats, e.g. JSON or even plain text.
				</p>

				<p>
					You already have seen a couple of examples on how to create an XMLHttpRequest object.
				</p>

				<p>
					Listed below are some of the methods and properties that you have to get familiar with.
				</p>

				<h3>XMLHttpRequest Methods</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>abort()</strong>
							<div>Cancels the current request.</div>
						</li>
						<li><strong>getAllResponseHeaders()</strong>
							<div>Returns the complete set of HTTP headers as a string.</div>
						</li>
						<li><strong>getResponseHeader( headerName )</strong>
							<div>Returns the value of the specified HTTP header.</div>
						</li>
						<li><strong>open( method, URL )</strong></li>
						<li><strong>open( method, URL, async )</strong></li>
						<li><strong>open( method, URL, async, userName )</strong></li>
						<li><strong>open( method, URL, async, userName, password )</strong>
							<div>
								<p>Specifies the method, URL, and other optional attributes of a request.</p>
								<p>The method parameter can have a value of "GET", "POST", or "HEAD". Other HTTP methods such as "PUT" and "DELETE" (primarily used in REST applications) may be possible.</p>
								<p>The "async" parameter specifies whether the request should be handled asynchronously or not. "true" means that the script processing carries on after the send() method without waiting for a response, and "false" means that the script waits for a response before continuing script processing.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li><strong>send( content )</strong>
							<div>Sends the request.</div></li>
						<li><strong>setRequestHeader( label, value )</strong>
							<div>Adds a label/value pair to the HTTP header to be sent.</div></li>
					</ul>

					<h3>XMLHttpRequest Properties</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>onreadystatechange</strong>
							<div>An event handler for an event that fires at every state change.
							</div></li>
						<li><strong>readyState</strong>
							<div><p>The readyState property defines the current state of the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>
								<p>The following table provides a list of the possible values for the readyState property −</p>
								<table>
									<tr>
										<th>State</th>
										<th>Description</th>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>0</td>
										<td>The request is not initialized.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>1</td>
										<td>The request has been set up.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>2</td>
										<td>The request has been sent.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>3</td>
										<td>The request is in process.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>4</td>
										<td>The request is completed.</td>
									</tr>
								</table>
								<p><strong>readyState = 0</strong> After you have created the XMLHttpRequest object, but before you have called the open() method.</p>
								<p><strong>readyState = 1</strong> After you have called the open() method, but before you have called send().</p>
								<p><strong>readyState = 2</strong> After you have called send().</p>
								<p><strong>readyState = 3</strong> After the browser has established a communication with the server, but before the server has completed the response.</p>
								<p><strong>readyState = 4</strong> After the request has been completed, and the response data has been completely received from the server.</p>
						</li>
						<li><strong>responseText</strong>
							<div>Returns the response as a string.</div></li>
						<li><strong>responseXML</strong>
							<div>Returns the response as XML. This property returns an XML document object, which can be examined and parsed using the W3C DOM node tree methods and properties.</div></li>
						<li><strong>status</strong>
							<div>Returns the status as a number (e.g., 404 for "Not Found" and 200 for "OK").</div></li>
						<li><strong>statusText</strong>
							<div>Returns the status as a string (e.g., "Not Found" or "OK").</div></li>
